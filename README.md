Play Tic Tac Toe Against 3 Different AI's

Meet the AI's:

Goldfish 
- I hooked up my pet goldish to a camera set up so he can beat you in Tic Tac Toe!
- In reality, this AI simply chooses a random available square to play on.
- Very easy to beat, but there is the slight chance that my Goldfish plays some Magnus Carleson level Tic Tac Toe and beats you horrendously!

Average
- The perfect opponent for someone who only plays Tic Tac Toe at those diners where they give you crayons while you wait for your meal
- Picks randomly unless it has a move which lets it win or sees you have a move which will let you win
- Actually somewhat challenging for someone who isn't a Tic Tac Toe nerd

Impossible:
- Trained by ChatGPT and the pure brain power of all Tic Tac Toe Players, this AI has never known defeat, seriously.
- In actuality, this AI uses a popular min-max algorithm to guarrantee a tie or a win for itself (thats right, Tic Tac Toe is solved)
- I wasn't joking when I said it was impossible.

Gameplay:
Choose who goes first and then your opponent, you play X while the AI plays O, be the first to get 3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. If no-one can before the board is filled, its a tie.
